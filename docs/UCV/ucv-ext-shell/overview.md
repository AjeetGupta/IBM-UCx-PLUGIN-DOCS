## Overview

A shell is a program that provides an interface to the services of the operating system either through a command-line interface (CLI) or graphical user interface (GUI). For either interface, the primary purpose of the shell is to call or start another program. Shells frequently have more capabilities such as viewing the contents of directories. The Shell plugin for HCL Accelerate allow you to include running a shell as part of a release task.
