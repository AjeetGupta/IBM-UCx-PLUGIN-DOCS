# Overview


### Overview


The GitLab plug-in provides for integration with a GitLab server. This plug-in imports issues,
commits, merge requests and builds from a GitLab server and provides a single view of GitLab data in UrbanCode Velocity
value stream map. Data between the GitLab server and the UrbanCode Velocity server is synchronized every five minutes.


Compatibility
-------------

* This plug-in requires UrbanCode Velocity version 1.2.1 or higher
* The plug-in
version 2.0.3 or higher requires UrbanCode Velocity version 1.5.5 or higher
* This plug-in supports GitLab version 9 or
higher
* This plug-in supports Cloud and On-Premises platform

**Note:** For integrations created before upgrading to
version 2.4.0 of UrbanCode Velocity, Auto-generated User Access Key is not present, so the integration will fail after
upgrading. In this case, you have to manually add a new User Access Key in the hidden property named ***UrbanCode
Velocity User Access Key.***
