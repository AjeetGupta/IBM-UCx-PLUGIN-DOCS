MicroFocus ALM (formerly HP Quality Center)
===========================================

The HP Quality Center Plugin enables you to add interactions with an HP Quality Center server into your IBM UrbanCode Deploy Processes. Typically, this is for the purpose of running tests and adding a status to a Component Version that will either allow or deny it from being promoted to the next Environment in your SDLC.

This plug-in uses Visual Basic scripts to connect to the HP Quality Center server and must run on a system that has access to OTAClient.dll.

**Platform Support:**

* This plug-in is supported to run on all Microsoft Windows operating systems supported by the UrbanCode Deploy agent
* This plug-in is supported to run against HP Quality Center v11, v11.5, and v12
