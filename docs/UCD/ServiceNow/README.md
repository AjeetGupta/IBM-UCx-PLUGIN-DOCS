ServiceNow
==========


**Note:** *Beginning with Version 21 of the plug-in, the following steps no longer require sys\_ids, but take the record
 number (ex. CHG0040001) instead:*



- Check Records

- Delete Records

- Update Records



ServiceNow integrates ITIL 
v3 processes, social collaboration for IT departments, software-as-a-service delivery, and modern Web functionality to 
deliver a flexible, easy-to-use and self-managing application.


The ServiceNow plugin allows UrbanCode Deploy to easily
 perform CRUD operations on records with convenient steps such as check and query records. It is tested for 
compatibility with ServiceNow versions Eureka through Madrid.
