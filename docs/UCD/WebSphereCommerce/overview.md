IBM WebSphere Commerce - Overview
=================================

# Overview



### Overview




 


### Overview


The WebSphere Commerce plug-in includes steps to install, configure, and deploy a 
server deployment package to a WebSphere Commerce server on a WebSphere Commerce cell.


To add the WebSphere Commerce 
plug-in steps to processes, click **Application Server > Java > Commerce > WebSphere Commerce** in the step palette of 
the process editor.


A typical deployment includes the following procedures:


* Create resources. To deploy a server 
deployment package to a WebSphere Commerce server, you must populate resources manually. You can view the resources that
 you create in the Resources view. Each resource corresponds to the WebSphere Commerce server.
* Define components, 
applications, and environments to automate deployment.
* Deploy.


### Compatibility


This plug-in requires version 
6.0.1 or later of IBM UrbanCode Deploy.


This plug-in also requires version 80 or later of the [WebSphere Application 
Server Deployment](https://www.urbancode.com/plugin/ibm-websphere-application-deployment-2/) plug-in.


The IBM 
UrbanCode Deploy plug-in for WebSphere Commerce works with WebSphere Commerce versions 7.0 and earlier. All editions are

The steps in this plug-in run on any agents 
that the IBM UrbanCode Deploy server supports.
