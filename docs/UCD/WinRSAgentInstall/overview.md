WinRS Agent Install - Overview
==============================

# Overview


### Overview




The WinRS Agent Install plug-in installs agents on Windows systems through WinRS. It contains a single step, which installs an agent. This step is equivalent to installing an agent from the server with the WinRS option.

### Compatibility

This plug-in requires IBM UrbanCode Deploy version 6.1 or later.

This plug-in works with versions of Windows that have Windows PowerShell, including Windows Server 2003, 2008, and 2012.

The step can run on any Windows operating system. However, to install an agent on the target system, that target system must be configured as described in [Installing agents on Windows through WinRS](http://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SS4GSP_6.1.2/com.ibm.udeploy.install.doc/topics/agent_install_winrs.html) in the product documentation.

### **Installation**

No special steps are required for installation. See [Installing plug-ins in UrbanCode Deploy](https://www.urbancode.com/resource/installing-plug-ins-in-urbancode-products/ "Installing plug-ins in UrbanCode Deploy").
