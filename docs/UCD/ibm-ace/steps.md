| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ACE Installation Directory | String | The installation directory of the IBM ACE server. For example: /opt/ibm/server. | Yes |
| Additional Arguments | String | A list of arguments to pass to the mqsicreatebroker script when running this step, for example: -i generalDefaultUserId. When specifying multiple arguments, list each arguments on a new line. | No |
| Integration Node (Broker) | String | The name of the integration node to create. | Yes |
| Queue Manager | String | The name of your WebSphere MQ Queue Manager. If you do not specify a value for this property,a queue manager is not created. | No |
| Service Password | String | The password for the service user ID. | No |
| Service User ID | String | The user ID under which the broker runs. | No |


Create Integration Server
-------------------------


Create integration servers.




| Name | Type | Description | Required |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| IP | String | The IP address of the target integration node. | Yes |
| Integration Servers | String | A list of integration servers to create. The servers must be defined on the broker. Seperate each with a comma or new line. | Yes |
| Port | String | The port of the target integration node. | Yes |


Delete Integration Node
-----------------------


Delete an Integration Node (Broker).




| Name | Type | Description | Required |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ACE Installation Directory | String | The installation directory of the IBM ACE server. For example: /opt/ibm/server. | Yes |
| Delete Trace Files | Boolean | Check this box to delete the node’s trace files from its work directory. | No |
| Delete WebSphere MQ Queues | Boolean | Check this box to delete all current integration server administration security WebSphere MQ queues along with the integration node. | No |
| Integration Node (Broker) | String | The name of the integration node to delete. | Yes |


Delete Integration Server
-------------------------


Create integration servers.




| Name | Type | Description | Required |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| IP | String | The IP address of the target integration node. | Yes |
| Integration Servers | String | A list of integration servers to delete. The servers must be defined on the broker. Seperate each with a comma or new line. | Yes |
| Port | String | The port of the target integration node. | Yes |


Deploy

| IP Address | String | The host name or IP address of the computer on which the integration node or server is running. If you do not specify this parameter, a value that represents the local computer is used. | No |
| Integration Node FileName | String | The name of a .broker file that contains the connection details for an integration node or independent integration server. Include the location (path) and file name when you specify this parameter. | No |
| Integration Node Name | String | Name of a specific integration node. To connect to a remote integration node by name, you must also specify ip Address and port. | No |
