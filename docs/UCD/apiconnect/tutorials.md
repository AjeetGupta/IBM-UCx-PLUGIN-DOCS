### Using the plug-in with API Connect Version 2018




 


There are differences in using the IBM API Connect 
plug-in with the API Connect Version 2018 from the previous versions. The following video demonstrates how to use the 
plug-in with API Connect Version 2018. 





### Hybrid API DevOps




 



A DevOps platform for APIs provides the 
ability to streamline and automate the process of developing, building, testing and deploying APIs onto the API runtime 
cloud platform either when these APIs are organically developed or when they are exposed endpoints to existing backend 
services.




The GitHub repository [refarch-hybridcloud-blueportal-api](https://github.com/ibm-cloud-
architecture/refarch-hybridcloud-blueportal-api) provides an in depth tutorial on implementing GitHub, Jenkins, 
UrbanCode Deploy, and API Connect into a single devops integration. This walkthrough was first introduced as a full lab 
session at IBM Interconnect 2017.
