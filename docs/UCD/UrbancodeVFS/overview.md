IBM UrbanCode Deploy Versioned File Storage - Overview
======================================================

# Overview



### Overview





The steps in this plug-in work with versioned components. For example, the [Download Artifacts](steps#download_artifacts) step retrieves the latest version of a component. Most component deployment processes use this step to download the component artifacts to the agent system.


**Note**: For AIX systems, file permissions defined at the operating system level are not supported by the UrbanCode Deploy Versioned File Storage plug-in. The plug-in uses the permissions set by a process or script. The **chmod** command can be used to reset a permission to the value defined at the operating system level.


To add the IBM UrbanCode Deploy Versioned File Storage plug-in steps to processes, click **Repositories > Artifact > IBM UrbanCode Deploy** in the step palette of the process editor.
