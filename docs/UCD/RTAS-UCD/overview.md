IBM Rational Test Automation Server (RTAS) - Overview
=====================================================

# Overview


### Overview


The IBM Rational Test Automation Server plug-in provides for automation of testing using Rational Test Workbench. It allows you to integrate testing of complex application environments much earlier in the development lifecycle.

### Compatibility

This plug-in works with Rational Test Workbench v8.5 or higher.

The plug-in steps run on all IBM UrbanCode Deploy and Rational Test Control Panel Ant client agents.

This plug-in is not compatible with agents on z/OS.

### Installation

No special steps are required for installation. See [Installing plug-ins in UrbanCode Deploy](https://community.ibm.com/community/user/wasdevops/blogs/laurel-dickson-bull1/2022/06/13/install-plugins "Installing plug-ins in UrbanCode Deploy").

**Note:** You can install this plug-in without migrating or upgrading the last version of the plug-in. The previous plug-in version was called GreenHat.

### Known limitations

The [Start scenario](#start_scenario) and [Stop scenario](#stop_scenario) steps do not work within a transient environment.
