IBM Rational Test Automation Server (RTAS) - Overview
=====================================================

# Overview



### Overview




  The IBM Rational Test Automation Server plug-in provides for automation of testing using Rational 
Test Workbench. It allows you to integrate testing of complex application environments much earlier in the development 
lifecycle. 


### Compatibility


This plug-in works with Rational Test Workbench v8.5 or higher.


The plug-in steps 
run on all IBM UrbanCode Deploy and Rational Test Control Panel Ant client agents.


This plug-in is not compatible with
 agents on z/OS. 


### Installation


No special steps are required for installation. See [Installing plug-ins in 
UrbanCode Deploy](https://www.urbancode.com/resource/installing-plug-ins-in-urbancode-products/ "Installing plug-ins in 
UrbanCode Deploy").


**Note:** You can install this plug-in without migrating or upgrading the last version of the 
plug-in. The previous plug-in version was called GreenHat.


### Known limitations


The [Start 
scenario](#start_scenario) and [Stop scenario](#stop_scenario) steps do not work within a transient environment.
