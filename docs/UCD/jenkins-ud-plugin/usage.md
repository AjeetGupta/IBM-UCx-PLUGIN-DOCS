Jenkins Publisher - Usage
=========================

# Usage



### Usage





This plug-in is installed into the Jenkins server and provides the ability to publish artifacts into an IBM UrbanCode Deploy component as a post-build action.


For the Jenkins build step rather than the post-build action, refer to the [Jenkins Job Manager plug-in](https://www.urbancode.com/plugin/jenkins-job-manager/).


The following pages provide usage information about Jenkins Publisher post-build integration:
