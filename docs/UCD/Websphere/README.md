# WebSphere Application Server - Deployment

The WebSphere Application Server – Deployment plug-in provides a number of steps for deploying application files to and performing administrative tasks for WebSphere Application Server. The plug-in also contains a number of steps that are related to configuration management, such as creating data sources and JMS requests. These configuration steps are deprecated; instead, use the WebSphere Application Server – Configure plug-in for all configuration-related activities.
